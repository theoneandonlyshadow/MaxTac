## Roadmap

See the [portfolio](https://maxtac.tech/) for my detailed roadmap and about how i got this idea.

## License

Invokes EULA license. Please read the [License](license.md) page.
## Important

This is a closed source project. Source code will not be public. It is done so to protect the integrity of MaxTac without the fear of getting stolen or improvised and avoid reselling without any credit for the actual author (me).

However, dependencies and installation process will be shared in some time to recreate the project on your own.
