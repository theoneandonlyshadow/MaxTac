These sub projects work together to collect and analyze data and process it for the best suitable results for the users.

Note: MaxTac is **not** an open source project. It's source code will not be public and this applies to all the MaxTac projects.

## Roadmap

See the [portfolio](https://theoneandonlyshadow.github.io/madhav.github.io/) for my detailed roadmap and about how i got this idea.

## License

This is a Closed Source Project. Henceforth, source code will not be public. Please read why below.

## Important

This is a closed source project. Source code will not be public. It is done so to protect the integrity of MaxTac without the fear of getting stolen or improvised and avoid reselling without any credit for the actual author (me). Any data that is collected by MaxTac is encrypted in `AES 256` in `CBC` mode.

However, dependencies and installation process will be shared in some time to recreate the project on your own.
